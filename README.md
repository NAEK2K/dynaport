# dynaport

Dynaport serves as a python module that will enable you to dynamically import modules from anywhere on the filesystem. This module acts as a wrapper of the python import library to offer an easy to use syntax for dynamically importing modules in python.

## Future Work

- offer the ability to define configuration files to quickly import modules
- allow paths with environment variables to be passed into the program
- creating compatible versions for both python2 and python3
- uploading the package to pip for easier access to its functionality
